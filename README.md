## Adding new fonts

#### Adding the JetBrainsMono font

- Download the `JetBrains` fonts from their [github repository](https://github.com/JetBrains)
- Create a folder named `assets` and inside that create `fonts` folder and paste the `JetBrainsMonoNL-Regular.ttf` file
- Go to `pubspec.yaml` And write

```
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: JetBrainsMonoNL
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/JetBrainsMonoNL-Regular.ttf

```

- Restart your project and there you go, you can now use any font of your choice.
